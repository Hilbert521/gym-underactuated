# Underactuated Systems (under development)

This repository contains modified OpenAI gym environments for continuous control.  Environments currently under development include the Double Inverted Pendulum, Acrowheel, and various models for monoped (Raibert style hoppers) and biped walking (SLIP). Contributions are greatly appreciated.
